sfSugarCRM plugin for Symfony
=============================

Overview
--------

The sfSugarCRM plugin wraps up the WSDL functionality provided by SugarCRM, simplifying the process of sending 
requests and handling reponses.  SOAP connections are handled by the sfSugarCRMSOAPClient class, so it is 
theoretically possible to manage multiple WSDL documents at once.

The plugin allows you to interact with a SugarCRM installation, without the need for your users to work directly with 
the software.  For example, you could create a simple HTML form that gathers basic information about a contact and 
then pass that information cleanly into the CRM.  You would then be able to either gracefully fail if there was an 
error, or display an appropriate "thank you" message.

Requirements
------------

PHP5's native SOAP extension - SoapClient is used to communicate with the remote SugarCRM installation.  This 
extension is enabled by default, but you may need to reconfigure your PHP build if this is not the case.  Third party 
SOAP solutions are not catered for at this point in time, but that may change depending on user demand.

A working installation of SugarCRM is also required.  This plugin was developed with version 4.5.0, but should work 
perfectly with the latest stable build.

Installation
------------

Move into your Symfony project directory and issue the following command:

`symfony plugin-install http://plugins.symfony-project.com/sfSugarCRMPlugin`

Alternatively, you can install the plugin via SVN.  Move into your Symfony project directory and issue the following 
command:

`svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfSugarCRMPlugin/ ./plugins/sfSugarCRMPlugin`

Once the plugin is installed, simply clear your cache in order to autoload the new classes:

`symfony cc`

Usage
-----

Inside your action, you would do the following:

{{{
$sugar = new sfSugarCRM('http://foo/crm/soap.php?wdsl');
$sugar->setUsername('jbloggs');
$sugar->setPassword('mypass123');
$sugar->getUserlist();
$response = $sugar->getResponse();
}}}

You would then deal with the SOAP response and act accordingly.

Support
-------

If you have any feedback or issues with this plugin, please post a thread on the 'Plug-ins' subforum on the Symfony 
website.  Alternatively, I can be contacted on the official Symfony IRC channel - #symfony on irc.freenode.net - my 
nickname there, funnily enough, is 'superhaggis'. :-)
